des & Brief text description of the result of the pitch: Ball; Ball In
      Dirt; Called Strike; Foul; Foul (Runner Going); Foul Tip; Hit by
      Pitch; In play, no out; In play, out(s); In play, run(s); Intent
      Ball; Pitchout; Swinging Strike; Swinging Strike (Blocked).\\[4pt]
id & Unique identification number per pitch within a game. The numbers
     increment by one for each pitch but are not consecutive between
     at bats.\\[4pt]
type & One-letter abbreviation for the result of the pitch: B, ball;
       S, strike (including fouls); X, in play.\\[4pt]
x, y & Horizontal and vertical location of the pitch as it crossed
       home plate as input by the Gameday stringer using the old
       Gameday coordinate system. I'm not sure what units are used or
       where the origin is located. Note that the y dimension in the
       old coordinate system is now called the z dimension in the new
       Pitch F/X coordinate system detailed below.\\[4pt]
num & At bat number.\\[4pt]
start\_speed & Pitch speed, in miles per hour and in three dimensions,
               measured at the initial point, y0. Of the two speeds,
               this one is closer to the speed measured by a radar gun
               and what we are familiar with for a pitcher's
               ``velocity'' .\\[4pt]
end\_speed & Pitch speed measured as it crossed the front of home
             plate.\\[4pt]
sz\_top & Distance in feet from the ground to the top of the current
          batter's rulebook strike zone as measured from the video by
          the Pitch F/X operator. The operator sets a line at the
          batter's belt as he settles into the hitting position, and
          the Pitch F/X software adds four inches up for the top of the
          zone.\\[4pt]
sz\_bot & Distance in feet from the ground to the bottom of the
          current batter's rulebook strike zone. The Pitch F/X operator
          sets a line at the hollow of the knee for the bottom of the
          zone.\\[4pt]
pfx\_x & Horizontal movement, in inches, of the pitch between the
         release point and home plate, as compared to a theoretical
         pitch thrown at the same speed with no spin-induced
         movement. This parameter is measured at y=40 feet regardless
         of the y0 value.\\[4pt]
pfx\_z & Vertical movement, in inches, of the pitch between the
         release point and home plate, as compared to a theoretical
         pitch thrown at the same speed with no spin-induced
         movement. This parameter is measured at y=40 feet regardless
         of the y0 value.\\[4pt]
px & Left/right distance, in feet, of the pitch from the middle of the
     plate as it crossed home plate. The Pitch F/X coordinate system is
     oriented to the catcher's/umpire's perspective, with distances to
     the right being positive and to the left being negative.\\[4pt]
pz & Height of the pitch in feet as it crossed the front of home
     plate.\\[4pt]
x0 & Left/right distance, in feet, of the pitch, measured at the
     initial point.\\[4pt]
y0 & Distance in feet from home plate where the Pitch F/X system is set
     to measure the initial parameters. This parameter has been
     variously set at 40, 50, or 55 feet (and in a few instances 45
     feet) from the plate at different times throughout the 2007
     season as Sportvision experiments with optimal settings for the
     Pitch F/X measurements. Sportvision settled on 50 feet in the
     second half of 2007, and this value of y0=50 feet has been used
     since. Changes in this parameter impact the values of all other
     parameters measured at the release point, such as
     start\_speed.\\[4pt]
z0 & Height, in feet, of the pitch, measured at the initial
     point.\\[4pt]
vx0, vy0, vz0 & Velocity of the pitch, in feet per second, in three
                dimensions, measured at the initial point.\\[4pt]
ax, ay, az & Acceleration of the pitch, in feet per second per second,
             in three dimensions, measured at the initial
             point.\\[4pt]
break\_y & Distance in feet from home plate to the point in the pitch
           trajectory where the pitch achieved its greatest deviation
           from the straight line path between the release point and
           the front of home plate.\\[4pt]
break\_angle & Angle, in degrees, from vertical to the straight line
               path from the release point to where the pitch crossed
               the front of home plate, as seen from the
               catcher's/umpire's perspective.\\[4pt]
break\_length & Measurement of the greatest distance, in inches,
                between the trajectory of the pitch at any point
                between the release point and the front of home plate,
                and the straight line path from the release point and
                the front of home plate, per the MLB Gameday
                team. John Walsh's article ``In Search of the
                Sinker'' has a good illustration of this
                parameter.\\[4pt]
sv\_id & A date/time stamp of when the Pitch F/X tracking system first
         detected the pitch in the air, it is in the format
         YYMMDD\_hhmmss.\\[4pt]
pitch\_type & Most probable pitch type according to a neural net
              classification algorithm developed by Ross Paul of
              MLBAM.\\[4pt]
type\_confidence & Value of the weight at the classification
                   algorithm's output node corresponding to the most
                   probable pitch type, this value is multiplied by a
                   factor of 1.5 if the pitch is known by MLBAM to be
                   part of the pitcher's repertoire\\[4pt]
zone & Appears to correspond to the location of the pitch based on the
       boxes into which the Gameday app divides the strike zone for
       its hot/cold zone graphics\\[4pt]
nasty & The ``nasty'' field is presumably a crude attempt to calculate
        how hard to hit a particular pitch was, on a scale of
        0-100. My initial cursory look at the data indicates that they
        are calculating the ``nasty'' factor mostly based on the
        location of the pitch, a linear calculation of how close it is
        to the edges and away from the heart of the zone. For the
        fastball, MLBAM does not appear to be including anything
        related to the movement or speed of the pitch into the ``nasty''
        factor. For the curveball, they appear to be rating sweeping
        curveballs as significantly more nasty than 12-to-6
        curveballs. Anyway, Iâ€™m not sure that any of this matters as
        more than a curiosity \\[4pt]
cc & comment field that appears to my[Mike Fast] highly-trained eye to
     be auto-generated, probably also based on the hot/cold zone
     information that MLBAM tracks \\[4pt]

Ideas for physical pitcher measures:

- Release points (c.f. Mike Fast article on calculation method):
consistency within games\& accross games (clustered by pitch type?), location by pitch type
